This is a fun project made using the https://swapi.co/.

## **How much points can you get? ‚öîÔ∏è**

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) using ``--typescript`` argument.

## How to run

**First you need to get the credentials, follow the "Credentials" topic below.**

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Credentials:
Two credentials are required for the google search to work.
- First you need to visit: https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/overview and click on the "Get a key" button
- Second you'll need a custom search engine id, for that you can visit: https://cse.google.com/cse, put "google.com" on the website box and then proceed with the creation. Then check the "Image search" and "Search the entire web" and copy the "Search engine ID" field.
- Third, I am also using bing as an option, so you have to go to the azure portal and create a "Bing Search v7" resource, after you created it, go to its options and copy one of its "keys", if you don't know how, check out: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account.

Then create the following file:
```./src/AssirStarQuiz/Credentials.json```
```json
{
    "googleImagesContext": "SEARCH_ENGINE_ID",
	"googleImagesApiKey": "API_KEY",
    "bingSubscriptionKey": "BING_SEARCH_KEY"
}
```
